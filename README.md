# Vue3 System Invoice App

This is a version in vue3 whit typescript of [https://github.com/fatihozoglu/vue-invoice-app](https://github.com/fatihozoglu/vue-invoice-app)  You can keep track of your personal invoices with this app. You can create a new invoice, save it as a draft or as pending, mark pending invoices as paid and edit any draft or pending invoices. Also you can filter the invoices by their draft/pending/paid status.

You can see the [live demo here.](https://fozoglu-vue-invoice-app.surge.sh/)

I am planning to build this as a Full Stack Web Application by adding a NodeJS/Expressjs server and Mongodb/Postgresql Database.

This project is built with:

- Frontend Framework: [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/)
- Created with: [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/),
- For state pinia: [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/),
- For routing: [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/),
- For form validations: [Vuelidate](https://vuelidate.js.org/).
